OVERVIEW:
This is the final project of Cornell University's CS2110 Fall 2023 course. Students implemented 
algorithms to help the protagonist, McDiver, locate a special ring hidden in the sewer network. 
Equipped with a detector, McDiver must traverse the maze efficiently, leveraging advanced data 
structures like heaps to optimize graph searches. Upon finding the ring, McDiver faces new 
challenges in a lower level of tunnels, collecting treasure while avoiding toxic fumes and 
exiting the sewer in a limited number of steps. The assignment requires knowledge such as graph 
algorithms and synchronizing concurrent code.
